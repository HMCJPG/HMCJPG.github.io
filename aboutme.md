subtitle: Who is Jason Gounder?
---

My name is Jason. I'm a second year student at Harvey Mudd College, pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. As of now, I am a member of Shia Lab at HMC, where we work on state estimatation with Kalman Filters. Stay tuned for our publication!

### My story

I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, where I was fortunate enough to be immersed in the realm of cybersecurity through the AZ Cyber Initiative Bootcamp in early high school -- I now support the same bootcamp as an intern! Talk about coming full circle.

So... why cybersecurity?

In an era increasingly defined by technology, the threat of cyberattacks looms large, affecting individuals and small businesses, with personal experiences underscoring the severity for me. A family incident involving cyber theft revealed the vulnerability of those without adequate defenses, fueling my desire to enter cybersecurity. I knew that I couldn't idle by -- this would be the field where I would make a difference.

My commitment has manifested in active participation in Arizonaâ€™s cybersecurity initiatives and educating vulnerable groups on digital safety. My past research on cryptography and my Mathematics and Computer Science degree from Harvey Mudd College, combined with progress toward CEH and CISA certifications, form a robust foundation for contributing to the field. I love learning about cryptography, math, cybersecurity practices, with dreams of working for the FBI.
